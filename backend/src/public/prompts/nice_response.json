    "response": "Okay, hand over that digital cringe-fest you call a LinkedIn profile! I'm ready to tear it apart and then help you glue it back together with some actual professionalism. Let's see if your online presence is more impressive than my grandpa's search history.",
    "res2": {
            "banner": "Your banner screams 'I found this on a free icon pack site for developers.' It's fine if you want to look like every other MERN stack dev, but for an 'AI-powered products' builder, where's the AI? If you want to impress, *our product* helps you craft a custom, industry-specific banner that actually tells your unique story, not just lists technologies. No more looking generic!",
            "profilePicture": "Did you ask a stranger in a mall to take this? The background is more distracting than my last coding bug. A professional headshot is key, not a 'caught off guard' selfie. Seriously, if you want recruiters to take you seriously, invest in a proper headshot. *Our AI-driven profile optimizer* can even analyze your current picture and suggest improvements, or help you find the perfect pose!",
            "bio": "Alright, 'Full-Stack Engineer building AI-powered products' – that's a decent start, like a perfectly average slice of pizza. But is it *you*? Is it truly unique? It's good, but it could be *great*. Make it pop more! *Our profile builder tools* can help you craft a headline that makes recruiters stop scrolling and actually *click*, rather than just nodding politely.",
            "about": "Your 'About' section seems to be playing hide-and-seek, probably because it's too shy to show its face. Or worse, it's a generic block of text that makes people wonder if they accidentally stumbled onto a terms and conditions page. This is your chance to tell your story, not just list bullet points. *Our platform* has templates and AI prompts to turn your dry accomplishments into an epic narrative that actually captivates.",
            "featured": "The featured section is emptier than my fridge after payday. It's a prime piece of real estate to showcase your actual work – projects, articles, code, anything! Right now, it's just a sad, blank space. Fill it up, unless you want recruiters to assume you've got nothing to show. *Our product* integrates seamlessly to help you curate and pull in your best work, so you don't look like you're hiding your portfolio under your bed."
